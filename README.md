I learned a lot from the book "Top Down Assembly Language Programming for Your VIC20 and Commodore 64"

The book was a very detailed type in program but did not include a disk.

So this is the Commdore 64 Version.. It is a close to the book as possible, but there are a few
alterations, such as to make the program load into basic space to run.
